# virtualshelf
A virtual bookshelf display to remind you and your friends how well read you are even if you don't have room for dozens of dead-tree books.

I reckon I'll see what can be done in jupyter notebook just to get a feel for the Goodreads API and explore how I can / want to display the books. Covers seems like a good idea, but spines could be useful sometimes... I'd have to generate spine images probably, just from the titles and authors, using, say, the two colors most well-represented in the cover? Hmm.
